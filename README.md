This project aims to detect and classify diseases in plants using images of leaves, stems, and roots. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Learning techniques, this system helps farmers and agricultural experts identify plant diseases early, enabling timely intervention and minimizing crop loss.
