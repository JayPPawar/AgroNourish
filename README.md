# AgroNourish
This project aims to detect and classify diseases in plants using images of leaves, stems, and roots. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Learning techniques, this system helps farmers and agricultural experts identify plant diseases early, enabling timely intervention and minimizing crop loss.

# Features
Image Classification: Accurately identifies diseases from images of plant leaves, stems, and roots.

Real-time Predictions: Provides instant feedback on plant health through a web-based interface.

User-friendly Interface: Easy to use for both technical and non-technical users.

Pre-trained Models: Utilizes pre-trained models for efficient and accurate disease detection.

# Technology Stack
TensorFlow: For building and training the machine learning model.

Flask: For creating a web-based interface to interact with the model.

Python: Primary programming language used in the project.

# Dataset
The project uses the Plant Village Dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled images of various plant diseases.

# Installation
1.Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/Plant-Disease-Detection.git
  cd Plant-Disease-Detection

2.Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the Flask application:
  python app.py

4.Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000.

5.Upload an image of a plant part (leaf, stem, or root) to get a real-time prediction of the disease.
